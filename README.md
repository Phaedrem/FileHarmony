This project is a recreation of my [original program](https://github.com/Phaedrem/metadata-file-rename). 

It's been updated and/or upgraded to include a system agnostic GUI rather than run from a command console.
When it comes to audio files there doesn’t seem to be an accepted standard in regards to using metadata and file naming. 
As someone who has built up a large collection of digital music I found that every album and/or source would throw in metadata information such as author, album name, track name, etc. at random into the file name. 
This would make organizing collections and finding specific files a nightmare. 
Rather than renaming each file individually I built a program thats loops through all checked files and/or folders and renames the files to match the file’s title metadata.
